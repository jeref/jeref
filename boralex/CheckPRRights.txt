Protect Develop & master from being deleted
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52285410/protect-github-branches-from-being-deleted
- merge after new Rules on main & develop
you have to bypass rukles to merge without pull requests but no more delete branch question
- test merge from master to develop
PR restriction to merge ==> no delete asking !
- test 3 : delete develop rule (==> no rule)
==> delete develop asked
-test 4 : PR master --> develop
==> pas de demande de suppression dans ce sens
- test 5 : new rule for develop (require PR, but no approvals) OK
- test 6 : rule develop "Require approvals" : should notchange anything
